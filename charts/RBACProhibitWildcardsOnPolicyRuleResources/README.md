# Rbac Prohibit Wildcards on Policy Rule Resources

This Policy prohibits various resources from being set with wildcards for Role or ClusterRole resources, except for the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole. It will check each resource specified for the verb specified. The wildcards will be checked in:

### Resources

In the Kubernetes API, most resources are represented and accessed using a string representation of their object name, such as pods for a Pod. RBAC refers to resources using exactly the same name that appears in the URL for the relevant API endpoint.

### Verbs

API verbs like get, list, create, update, patch, watch, delete, and deletecollection are used for resource requests.

### API Groups

The API Group being accessed (for resource requests only).

### Non Resource URLs

Requests to endpoints other than /api/v1/... or /apis/<group>/<version>/... are considered "non-resource requests", and use the lower-cased HTTP method of the request as the verb.

Replace the `*` with the appropriate resource. The type of

rules:
- <attributes>:
  - '*'

```
