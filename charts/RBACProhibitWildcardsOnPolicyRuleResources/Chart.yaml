description: "This Policy prohibits various resources from being set with wildcards
  for Role or ClusterRole resources, except for the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole. It
  will check each resource specified for the verb specified. The wildcards will be
  checked in:\n\n### Resources\nIn the Kubernetes API, most resources are represented
  and accessed using a string representation of their object name, such as pods for
  a Pod. RBAC refers to resources using exactly the same name that appears in the
  URL for the relevant API endpoint. \n\n### Verbs\nAPI verbs like get, list, create,
  update, patch, watch, delete, and deletecollection are used for resource requests.
  \n\n### API Groups\nThe API Group being accessed (for resource requests only).\n\n###
  Non Resource URLs\nRequests to endpoints other than /api/v1/... or /apis/<group>/<version>/...
  are considered \"non-resource requests\", and use the lower-cased HTTP method of
  the request as the verb.\n"
